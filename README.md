I'm a currently student at The University of Pennsylvania's Management and Technology (M&T) Program! I'm pursuing a B.S.E in Computer Science from the School of Engineering and B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School of Business. I have particular interests in using data to drive better decision-making and creating software to improve the quality of lives for others.

These interests have taken me to pursue a variety of projects. In the past, I've conducted data analytics and presented my findings to Fortune 500 companies/subsidiaries and created a novel deep learning algorithm to enhance the quality of medical scans. Some other projects of mine include video transcript summarization, a self-watering plant pot and accompanying mobile application, an implementation of the momentum trading algorithm, and a social media webscraper with sentiment analysis.

In my free time, I enjoy biking, playing chess, cooking, and watching Detroit sports.

Feel free to reach out for anything at mattdong@wharton.upenn.edu!
