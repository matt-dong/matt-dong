I'm currently a student at The University of Pennsylvania's Management and Technology (M&T) Program! I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from the School of Engineering and B.S. in Economics from Wharton. I have particular interests in using data to drive better decision-making and creating software to improve the quality of lives for others.

I'm currently working on product and webdev at [Hack4Impact](https://github.com/hack4impact-upenn). In the past, I interened at [Tempus Ex ](https://tempus-ex.com/) as a software engineering intern, where I worked on low-latency data delivery services for live, professional sporting events (such as NFL games). I've also conducted data analytics and presented my findings to Fortune 100 companies/subsidiaries and created a novel deep learning algorithm to enhance the quality of medical scans. Some of my other projects/research focus on NLP/ML, webscraping, browswer automation, and algorithmic trading.

In my free time, I enjoy biking, playing chess, food photography, and watching Detroit sports.

Feel free to reach out for anything at mattdong@wharton.upenn.edu!
